            There isn't a widely recognized Kalyan Dam in Tirupati, Andhra Pradesh, India. 
            However, there could be local or lesser-known dams with the name "Kalyan Dam" in the vicinity.
             If it's a newly constructed or named dam, you may want to check with local authorities or explore local resources for more information about its location, purpose, and any associated attractions or amenities.
