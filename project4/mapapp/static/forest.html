            The Seshachalam Forest is situated in the Eastern Ghats mountain range, which runs parallel to the eastern coast of India. 
            It covers a vast area with rugged terrain, deep valleys, and steep slopes, making it an ecologically diverse region.
           The forest is known for its rich biodiversity, housing a wide variety of plant and animal species. It is home to several endemic and endangered species, including the Red Sanders (Pterocarpus santalinus) tree, which is highly valued for its red sandalwood.
